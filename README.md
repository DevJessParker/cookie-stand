Color alternating issue [:nth - child(odd)] resolved by re-rendering entire table with innerHTML each time a new store is added. 

Attempted to complete stretch goal with innerHTML use of countdown clock function, but it would not render. Issue with Home page error message regarding table on Sales page, though error message does not get flagged on Sales page. Need to look into that further.
